The dumbbell bent-over fly is a classic back exercise, effective for increasing back width while also significantly stimulating the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and posterior deltoids. To perform the dumbbell bent-over fly: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent. Bend over, arms slightly bent, and hold the dumbbells in both hands. Focus your mind on engaging your back, keeping your arms bent and pulling the dumbbells upward until your upper arms are level with your back. Hold for 2 seconds, then slowly return while exerting force on your back.
