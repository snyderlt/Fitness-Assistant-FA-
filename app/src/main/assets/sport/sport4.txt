Lie on a flat bench, preferably with someone helping you lift a barbell or curl bar overhead. Keep your arms straight, maintaining a slight bend in your arms. Slowly lower the barbell to about a fist's length above your chest, keeping your elbows pointed at your sides. Extend your arms back to the starting position.
