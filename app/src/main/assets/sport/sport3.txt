Bench Press: Place the barbell just above your nipples. Your eyes should be directly below the barbell. Your back should be arched, resembling a bridge when viewed from the side, with your waist suspended in the air and only your shoulders and hips touching the bench. Next, pull your shoulders back and tighten your shoulder blades. You'll feel them draw together. Maintain this shoulder position throughout the entire press; it's crucial for the bench press.
