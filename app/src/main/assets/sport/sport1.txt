Push-ups are a comprehensive exercise that primarily targets the triceps, abdominals, back, and pectoralis major. Regular push-ups can broaden the shoulders and strengthen the upper arms, lower abdomen, and chest muscles, resulting in a more balanced and upright physique. Completing a single push-up requires close coordination of muscles in the arms, chest, abdomen, buttocks, and legs. Push-ups test nearly every part of the body, supporting weight with their own strength, providing the quickest and most accurate assessment of nerve and muscle function. Push-ups strengthen major muscles, providing the strength and muscle memory needed for forward extension and preventing falls.
