After doing push-ups, you can adjust slightly by finding a support point (a low chair or other hard furniture) about 30 cm high. Too high will cause imbalance, while too low will reduce the fitness effect. Key points: Maintain a push-up position with your upper body and place the balls of your feet on the support point to do push-ups. Keep your arms and shoulders parallel, with your palms positioned on either side of your shoulders, with your palms fully touching the ground. Duration: You can slightly slow down the frequency of push-ups and stick to doing 4 sets of 12 reps each.
